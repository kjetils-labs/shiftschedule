# What is Shiftschedule

It's a full stack application to keep an overview over shift schedules a team has. When, who, and what shift.

# Background

Our current work shift schedule isn't very good and I felt like I could make a better one.

I don't have any frontend or fullstack experience, only backend development, so this is also a learning experience for me.
